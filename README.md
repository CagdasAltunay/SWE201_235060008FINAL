# SWE201_235060008FINAL
Project Overview

This project is a simple Library Management Application developed using C# with an object-oriented programming approach. The main goal of the project is to practice class design, encapsulation, and relationships between classes at an introductory OOP level.

Class Design

The application is structured around multiple classes, each representing a real-world entity in a library system:

Book: Represents a book with properties such as title, author, ISBN, and availability status.

Member: Represents a library member who can borrow and return books.

Library: Acts as a controller class that manages books and members, and handles borrowing and returning operations.

Each class was designed with a single responsibility principle in mind to ensure clarity, reusability, and maintainability.

Object-Oriented Concepts Used

Encapsulation: Class properties are accessed through methods to protect data integrity.

Abstraction: Library operations are simplified through well-defined class methods.

Class Interaction: Classes interact with each other to simulate real library workflows.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic but structured use of object-oriented programming concepts in C#, suitable for introductory-level coursework such as SWE201.
